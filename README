NAME
        cli

DESCRIPTION
        Command line argument parsing.

        This package aims to provide tools for builing command line
        parsers. There are other haskell libraries for doing this
        such as cmdargs, however this library aims to take a different
        appoach, by leveraging data-lens and adding a few useful features.

USAGE
        T.B.C.
